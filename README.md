## üõ†Ô∏è Installation Guide

Follow these steps to get WindowsCV up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed.

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (LTS version recommended)

### Step-by-Step Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    Start by cloning the WindowsCV repository to your local machine using Git:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/A-S95/WindowsCV.git
    cd WindowsCV
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Navigate into the cloned directory and install all necessary Node.js packages:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Environment Configuration:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project to manage environment variables. This project uses `dotenv` for configuration.

    ```bash
    touch .env
    ```

    Open the `.env` file and add any required environment variables. For a basic setup, you might define a port:

    ```
    PORT=3000
    ```

    *Note: Depending on future features, other variables like API keys or proxy settings might be needed.*

4.  **Start the Server:**
    Once dependencies are installed and the `.env` file is configured, you can start the server:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    The server should now be running, typically on `http://localhost:3000` (or the port you specified in your `.env` file).


## üöÄ Usage Examples

Once the server is running, open your web browser and navigate to the address where the application is hosted (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).

You will be greeted by the WindowsCV interface. Interact with the elements on the page to explore the "little joke" and enjoy the nostalgic, humorous experience.
